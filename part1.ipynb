    "We've seen that [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org) are excellent libraries for analyzing tabular \"labeled data\". [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) is designed to make it easier to work with with _labeled multidimensional data_. By _multidimensional data_ (also often called _N-dimensional_), we mean data with many independent dimensions or axes. For example, we might represent Earth's surface temperature $T$ as a three dimensional variable\n",

    "* `coords`: a dict-like container of arrays (coordinates) that label each point (e.g., 1-dimensional arrays of numbers, datetime objects or strings)\n",
    "* `attrs`: an `OrderedDict` to hold arbitrary metadata (attributes)\n",

    "Note that xarray now provides us with a nice HTML representation of the underlying dask array and how it is divided into chunks. Ofen the best performance is obtained when chunks match data storage. This elevation data is stored as a Cloud Optimized Geotiff or ['COG'](https://www.cogeo.org), which typically are stored as 512x512 tiles. If you really want to dig into performance, have a look through [these notebooks](https://github.com/pangeo-data/cog-best-practices), but it's usually okay to pick chunks that are a multiple of the data tile size (512*n)"

    "### Dask clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask needs a collection of computing resources in order to perform parallel computations. Dask Clusters have different names corresponding to different computing environments (for example, [LocalCluster](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/local-cluster.html) for a single machine, [PBSCluster](http://jobqueue.dask.org/) for your HPC, or [Kubernetes Cluster](http://kubernetes.dask.org/) for machines distributed on the Cloud). Each cluster has a certain number of computing resources called 'Workers', that each get allocated CPU and RAM. The dask scheduling system maps jobs to each worker on a cluster for you, so the syntax is mostly the same once you initialize a cluster!"
