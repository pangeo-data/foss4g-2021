    "We've seen that [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org) are excellent libraries for analyzing tabular \"labeled data\". [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) is designed to make it easier to work with with _labeled multidimensional data_. By _multidimensional data_ (also often called _N-dimensional_), we mean data with many independent dimensions or axes. For example, we might represent Earth's surface temperature $T$ as a three dimensional variable\n",

    "$$ T(x, y, t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ and $y$ are spatial dimensions and and $t$ is time. By _labeled_, we mean data that has metadata associated with it describing the names and relationships between the variables. The cartoon below shows a \"data cube\" schematic dataset with temperature and preciptation sharing the same three dimensions, plus longitude and latitude as auxilliary coordinates.\n",

    "Like Pandas, xarray has two fundamental data structures:\n",
    "* a `DataArray`, which holds a single multi-dimensional variable and its coordinates\n",
    "* a `Dataset`, which holds multiple variables that potentially share the same coordinates\n",

    "\n",
    "A `DataArray` has four essential attributes:\n",
    "* `values`: a `numpy.ndarray` holding the array’s values\n",
    "* `dims`: dimension names for each axis (e.g., `('x', 'y', 'z')`)\n",
    "* `coords`: a dict-like container of arrays (coordinates) that label each point (e.g., 1-dimensional arrays of numbers, datetime objects or strings)\n",
    "* `attrs`: an `OrderedDict` to hold arbitrary metadata (attributes)\n",
    "\n",
